# Java-ToDoList
A simple command-line To-Do List application in Java. Create, edit and view tasks with persistent storage.

## Features
1. Create a new to-do list.
2. Add items to an existing list.
3. View the current list.
4. Taks are saved to a file (To-Do-List.txt)

## Resources Used
1. Java
2. File I/O(File, FileWriter, PrintWriter)
3. Scanner for user inut

## How To Run
1. Make sure Java is installed on your system.
2. Compile the program:
   javac ToDoList.java
3. Run the program:
   java ToDoList

## How It Works
The program displays a menu with options to create, edit, or display a to-do list.
Tasks are store in a text file so they remain after the program exits.
Input validation prevents empty tasks and handles missing files gracefully.

## File Structure
ToDoList.java - main source file
To-Do-List.txt - generated automatically to store tasks
